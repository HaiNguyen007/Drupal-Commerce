# Drupal-Commerce


**Client**: Shawn McCabe, Acromedia Inc.

**Background**: We are a web development company of about 40 people located in Kelowna. We do primarily ecommerce development in Drupal. We're doing a project with the University both for recruiting and to get some work done, hopefully we'd like to hire at least some of the team that works for us to work full time after they finish school. We're a pretty casual company, we don't have a dress code, although we'd prefer you came to work at least mostly clothed and hopefully bathed. Someone will put that goddamn Rebecca Black - Friday song over the office speakers EVERY SINGLE FRIDAY though, so there are some ups and downs.

**Project Description**: Acro Media wants to build a migration from Shopify to Drupal Commerce 2.x. We are hoping to cover at least Orders, Customers and Products, with additional data if time permits. The project will pull the appropriate data from Shopify and run it through Drupal's Migrate interface to map it to the appropriate schema in Drupal Commerce. You will be building a commerce_migrate_shopify that will handle the data transformations and have automated testing to insure integrity.
